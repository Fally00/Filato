## **Filato— Browser-Based File System Interface** ##

--> Filato is a lightweight web-based file system simulation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It provides a desktop-like interface in the browser, allowing users to interact with files, view system metrics, and navigate between different panels.

## **A live version is available** ##

--> [Filato](https://abdelrahmanshaalan.github.io/Filato/)

## **Overview** ##

- Filato offers a minimal web desktop environment with the following functionality:

- Edit and save text files (text.txt) directly in the browser

- Display simulated resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)

- Navigate through panels including Home, Desktop, Charts, and Logs

- Structured and expandable architecture for future development
```
This project serves as a foundation for learning interactive web applications
        & simulating desktop functionality in a browser environment.
```
