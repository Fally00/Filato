## **Filato— Browser-Based File System Interface** ##

-- Filato is a lightweight web-based file system simulation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It provides a desktop-like interface in the browser, allowing users to interact with files, view system metrics, and navigate between different panels.

**A live demo is available here**

## **Overview** ##

- Filato offers a minimal web desktop environment with the following functionality:

- Edit and save text files (text.txt) directly in the browser

- Display simulated resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)

- Navigate through panels including Home, Desktop, Charts, and Logs

- Structured and expandable architecture for future development
```
This project serves as a foundation for learning interactive web applications and simulating desktop functionality in a browser environment.
```

## **Technology Stack** ##

- HTML5 – Structure of the application

- CSS3 – Styling and layout

- JavaScript – Core functionality and interactivity

- Static assets (images/icons) for UI components
```
- The application is fully client-side and requires no backend.
```
## **Features** ##

- File Editor: Create, view, and edit a single text file.

- Resource Panel: Monitor simulated system metrics.

- Tabbed Navigation: Switch between multiple interface sections.

- Extensible Design: Modular structure for easy addition of new features.
